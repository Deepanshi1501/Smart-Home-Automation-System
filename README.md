# Smart-Home-Automation-System
The focus of our project is on helping users to operate home appliances with their own 
smartphones and to help elderly or handicapped people live a more independent life for as long 
as possible. The objective of our system is to take care of several domestic systems that may 
normally be difficult for those who are handicapped or elderly to take care of. We want to
develop a system based on IoT which can make home objects automatic and can be operated by 
the user in a friendly way with a web interface.
